**Mapbox GL JS OSS** is a Open-Source JavaScript library for interactive,
customizable vector maps on the web. It takes map styles that conform to the
[Mapbox Style Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/),
applies them to vector tiles that conform to the [Mapbox Vector Tile
Specification](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec), and renders them
using WebGL.

This is a hard-fork (no history) of the [Mapbox GL JS project at tag
v1.13.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/tree/v1.13.0), the last version
under an open-source license.

In addition to GL JS, this repository contains code, issues, and test fixtures that are common to both GL JS and the
native SDKs. For code and issues specific to the native SDKs, see the
[mapbox/mapbox-gl-native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/) repository.
